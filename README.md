# Analyzing long-term bird point count data from Seattle, WA
Analyses of Birds Connect Seattle's [Neighborhood Bird Project Data](https://birdsconnectsea.org/our-work/conservation/urban-conservation/neighborhood-bird-project/)

The Neighborhood Bird Project was launched in 1994 to monitor avian species richness in greenspaces around Seattle, Washington, USA.
